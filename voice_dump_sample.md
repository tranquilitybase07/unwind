"Okay, so... I need to finish that marketing report by Friday, it's really stressing me out because I haven't even started the data analysis part yet. Also, I need to call mom, I haven't spoken to her in a week and I feel guilty about it. Uh, what else? Oh, buy almond milk and those gluten-free crackers on the way home.

I'm really worried about that presentation next Tuesday, I feel like I'm going to freeze up. Maybe I should look into a public speaking coach? Or just practice more. Note to self: look up toastmasters nearby. My left shoulder is hurting again, probably from sitting too long, I need to book a physio appointment.

Did I pay the internet bill? Check that. And I had this idea for a blog post about... um... sustainable gardening in small apartments. I should write that down before I forget. Just... everything feels a bit much right now."
