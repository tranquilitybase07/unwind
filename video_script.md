### [0:00-0:20] The Struggle (Hook)

**(Visual: A split screen showing a person looking overwhelmed, staring at a messy notebook, and a chaotic animation of swirling thoughts like "Dishes", "Deadline", "Am I good enough?", "Call Mom".)**

**Voiceover:**
Does your mind feel like a browser with a hundred tabs open? For those of us with anxiety, ADHD, or just a busy life, the noise never stops. You have twenty thoughts racing at once—tasks, worries, ideas—and by the time you try to write them down, you’re already overwhelmed. Traditional to-do lists just feel... broken.

### [0:20-0:45] The Solution: Meet Unwind

**(Visual: The chaos on screen gently dissolves into a clean, soothing interface with the Unwind logo. A wave of calm colors washes over the screen.)**

### [0:45-1:15] Core Feature: The Voice Agent

**(Visual: A user tapping a microphone button. As they speak, words appear and float into organized buckets. Show the "Voice Agent" interface which looks warm and inviting, maybe a gentle pulsing circle.)**

It understands your stress, validates your feelings, and helps you process emotions in real-time. You can talk to it normally, just like a friend who’s always there to listen without judgment.

### [1:15-1:45] AI Chat & Pattern Discovery

**(Visual: Screen transitions to a chat interface. The user asks "Why do I feel anxious on Sundays?" and the AI responds with a graph or insight saying "I've noticed you often worry about work deadlines on Sunday evenings.")**

**Voiceover:**
But we go deeper. Unwind features a powerful AI Chat that acts as a mirror to your mind. You can chat with your own data to uncover hidden patterns you never knew existed. Ask it, "When am I most stressed?" or "What triggers my spirals?" Unwind uses your history to help you understand yourself better, turning invisible habits into actionable insights.

### [1:45-2:00] Conclusion (Call to Action)

**(Visual: The "Today View" showing just 3 manageable tasks. The user smiles and puts their phone down, looking relaxed. Text on screen: "Unwind your mind.")**
